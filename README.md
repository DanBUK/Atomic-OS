Summary
=======

Atomic OS is a "live" OS-like environment and SPA library/template for web app development.

At it's core, Atomic OS aims to provide to web developers features that desktop dev's take for granted: basic operating system features like a command interpreter and filesystem.

Included in Atomic OS is a simple scriptable command shell and basic desktop environment, giving developers absolute runtime access to their RIA & SPA applications.

Atomic OS hopes to help ameliorate dependence on the cloud by allowing app data to be stored within the microsystem itself, using a storage strategy established by TiddlyWiki.

Because Atomic OS is simply an html file, it is instantly a template, infinitely reusable and extremely easy to distribute.
